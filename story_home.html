For example, when we talked about how it would be better if you could be able to read the next news article using the left and right buttons on the +Control Pad, and how much better it would be if you could be able to change how long each news article is displayed during the Slide Show feature. Putting in these fixes as you're trying out the software is common when you're developing a video game, but doing something like this for an application was a new experience for me.</p>

News articles are updated and stored on Wii all the time, and I would like as many people as possible to use it everyday. I hope people can give its responsiveness and its great sense of feel a try. Also, try pressing the A button during the Slide Show feature to take a look at some of the news articles that you're interested in. There may be some news that you would have never known of otherwise if you weren't using the News Channel.</p>

                      <p>Speaking about the Slide Show, I have a friend who checks the news on his bedroom PC when he gets home from work, because he doesn't want to wake up his family by the sound the TV makes. He told me that ever since he bought a Wii, he now checks the news using the Slide Show feature on the News Channel in the living room. And when he's doing that, he told me that he can also check to see what his family was doing with Wii that day using the Wii Message Board, and from that information, he's able to imagine how his family was playing Wii that day. In my house, I can tell that my wife's been playing Picross on Wii. It's fun just imagining how your loved ones were playing.</p>

                      <p>The News Channel was made with the concept of it being used in the living room, so I would like everyone in the house to use it at the same time. Where a group of people is able to talk about a news topic that's being displayed on a screen, is something that doesn't happen on a PC. By using the News Channel in that kind of way, I hope it can help expand the range of communication that takes place in the living room. </p>
