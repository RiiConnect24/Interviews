We felt that this worked better than writing things down in a request form. Also, to better describe what we wanted, there were times where we actually went to Norway where Opera Software's headquarter is located.</p>

                      <p>At first, there was a gap in the philosophy Opera Software had towards PC software, with the philosophy Nintendo had towards video game software. Browsers on PCs tend to be made feature-rich so that it can perform multiple tasks, and I think this is a culture that is specific to PCs. Many features are put in, even though they further complicate the controls, and without a manual, it's hard to understand all the features. On the other hand, at Nintendo, we develop software emphasizing the importance of how the users can easily navigate through the game, without having to look at the manual. When we first envisioned using the Wii Remote so people could navigate through websites with one hand, we felt we could utilize the Wii Remote's intuitiveness where you are able to &quot;point&quot; directly at the screen, even though it may not be suited to perform precise movements like a mouse on PCs. For example, the cursor of the Wii Remote appears as a very large pointing finger on the screen of the browser. The cursor has looked like this from very early on in the development process. You're able to tell right where it is on the screen, and it's also the perfect size when you zoom in on the screen. I think this turned out to be something that is easy to use, even for grandpas and grandmas.</p>

                   <p>The other thing is, when you release a video game for home consoles, you need a lot of time before it can be released because of all the testing involved. It's a world where we work with things like discs and ROMs, and once they are released, there's no turning back. But in the case of a PC software, it is common to release downloadable updates, and users are accustomed in having to restart the software once something goes wrong. But things like that are absolutely not acceptable in the world of video games. So for us, releasing even just one title requires a great amount of preparedness. In the early stages of development, I think those differences were shown by our different development speeds during the early stages. </p>

                   <p>The thing was, at those first stages of development, I couldn't let go of the image that I had of conventional browsers on a PC, and I had a hard time deciding on how much of the browser's features I should leave for the Wii version. Around that time, a co-worker happened to walk by and look in on the screen that I was working on, so I started talking to him about how it worked. Right then, as I was walking through the features with him, it struck me. PCs are something that only one person would look at by themselves, but that experience that I had at that moment, was made possible only because we were using a TV screen. After that, I was able to cut off all unnecessary features that were not needed as a browser that was designed to be used on the TV. </p>

The new scroll feature works by pressing the B Button, and depending on what part of the screen your pressed it, and the direction and the distance you move the cursor, it will change the scroll speed...This is really difficult to explain in words, so I really would like people to try it our for themselves.</p>

To be honest, before we released the trial version, we had made the toolbar so that it could have been hidden. But we really couldn't justify adding that feature at the time because of concerns on how some people might not be able to understand the controls once the toolbar became hidden. But through the trial version, we felt a firm conviction that our users can definitely benefit from this feature, so in the full version, our customers are able to choose from different modes like the one where the toolbar will hide automatically after a while, and where the toolbar will hide away with a press of a button. As far as deciding on the perfect timing of when the toolbar should hide, we are spending a lot of time on it right now in deciding on its final timing.</p>

                      <p>We also received a lot of request about adding a keyboard hardware. At this time, Wii is not compatible with an external keyboard because of concerns like cost issues, but I do think it would be useful for text input, and it's definitely something to think about in the future. Also, with the software keyboard in the Japanese version, it's hard to tell the difference between the single byte and the double byte modes,<sup>1</sup> and we had received many questions from people in Japan about not being able to figure out how to type in single byte mode. Of course, in the full version these two modes in the Japanese version will be a lot easier to figure out, and for all versions, fixed URL text that are commonly used like &quot;www.&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; are displayed on the URL input screen, and they can now be easily entered. I think the usability has increased dramatically.</p>

However, due to the many feedback we received from our customers from the trial version, all the improvements that are to be implemented like the ones we have mentioned, and with fine-tuning the Channel to make it as compatible with as many websites as possible, the development process is taking longer than expected. Unlike the trial version, as we would like to thoroughly tune the Channel to ensure all the features that we would like to go in it are implemented, we are currently working so that the full version can be downloadable from the Wii Shop Channel sometime in April. I apologize that these issues have delayed its release, but I can tell you that we are working very hard on it, so please be patient while we are finalizing the full version.</p>

Of course, the opposite might just happen as well! (laughs)</p>
