You're then able to take the Mii's you've created and use them in other games, but this concept of creating caricature characters of yourself and people you know so they can be used in video games, was a concept that (Shigeru) Miyamoto-san had for a very long time. Miyamoto-san's concept called the &quot;Make someone you know project&quot; came up several times in the past, but most of the past attempts never led to fruition. You can say that he was persistent, but you can also say that he was stubborn! (laughs)</p>

It was a great title if you were able to manage its controls, but thinking in retrospect, I think the hurdle for that software was set a little too high for a lot of people. At the time of its release, the trend was to make things more feature-rich, and the software suffered from the controls being too complex.</p>

                  <p>The &quot;Make someone you know project&quot; lived on to the time when we were developing Wii Sports and Wii Play, which were both being developed for Wii. At this point, Miyamoto-san had renamed this project to the &quot;Kokeshi Concept&quot;. Kokeshis, which are traditional Japanese dolls with a cylindrically shaped body and a round head, eventually became what is now known as Miis. The major difference that the Mii had compared to the past concepts, was that Miyamoto-san now had a clear goal where he wanted the Mii data to be transferable to the Wii Remote, where it then could be carried around. But in order to be able to put a Mii inside a Wii Remote, we had to keep the file size as small as possible. Because of that, our development task became much more complex, and I was having a hard time figuring out what to do.</p>

Miyamoto-san, not those kokeshis again, please...&quot; (laughs) But he always felt that since it was something Miyamoto-san has been talking about for such a long time, he thought that there was something special about it.

We had always imagined that things in EAD were very punctual. On the other hand, the SPD where we work at, is a little different. It has a different mood. While the EAD develops big projects that take years to develop like The Legend of Zelda, we have a tendency to  develop games  like WarioWare: Smooth Moves, which are more impulsive and a little out of the ordinary!

                      <p>Including Takahashi-san and Okamoto-san, the people we teamed up with from SPD were all very young. This was the first time that I was one of the oldest people in a project team, so I was actually worried in the beginning. In past projects when there was a senior member above me, if somebody came up to me and asked something I didn't know of, I was just able to tell them to go ask that person in charge. But as I became the senior member of the team, I had to be the one to clearly explain everything because now, everyone came to me when they had any questions. It was now my responsibility if the staff didn't know something that they were supposed to. I learned that understanding something for yourself, is very different from understanding something enough that you're able to explain it to others.</p>

I felt that to make this really come to life, we had to be extremely careful in what we did.

But I felt that if we used a color chart, it would become too complicated for ordinary people. I mean, the Mii Channel was created to be something that can be used by the entire family. That's why it became the way it is now.</p>

We've been thinking of ways to make these things happen for a very long time.</p>

(In Japan only at this time), Nintendo sometimes sends out messages to our customers' Wiis, and you can attach and send a Mii with these messages. Just recently, we sent our customers in Japan Miis of the Japanese celebrities Sanma Akashiya and Shuzo Matsuoka. For those of you that live in Japan, please try connecting your Wii to the Internet if you haven't received them yet.</p>
